# Critical-Systems-Security

As part of the MSc Cyber security course, I have completed this module and its coursework has been uploaded. This module includes Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Supervisor Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. Students will examine and critique conventional ICS security and explore practical applications of ICS security.
